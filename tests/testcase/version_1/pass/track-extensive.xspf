      <!-- URL of resource to be rendered. Probably an audio resource, but MAY be any type of resource with a well-known duration, such as video, a SMIL document, or an XSPF document. The duration of the resource defined in this element defines the duration of rendering. xspf:track elements MAY contain zero or more location elements, but a user-agent MUST NOT render more than one of the named resources. -->
      <location>http://example.com/my.mp3</location>

      <!-- Canonical ID for this resource. Likely to be a hash or other location-independent name, such as a MusicBrainz identifier or isbn URN (if there existed isbn numbers for audio). MUST be a legal URN. xspf:playlist elements MAY contain zero or more identifier elements. -->

      <!-- Human-readable name of the track that authored the resource which defines the duration of track rendering. This value is primarily for fuzzy lookups, though a user-agent may display it. xspf:track elements MAY contain exactly one. -->
      <title>My Way</title>

      <!-- Human-readable name of the entity (author, authors, group, company, etc) that authored the resource which defines the duration of track rendering. This value is primarily for fuzzy lookups, though a user-agent may display it. xspf:track elements MAY contain exactly one. -->

      <!-- A human-readable comment on the track. This is character data, not HTML, and it may not contain markup. xspf:track elements MAY contain exactly one. -->
      <annotation>This is my theme song.</annotation>

      <!-- Human-readable name of the collection from which the resource which defines the duration of track rendering comes. For a song originally published as a part of a CD or LP, this would be the title of the original release.

      <album>Frank Sinatra&apos;s Greatest Hits</album>

      <!-- Integer with value greater than zero giving the ordinal position of the media on the xspf:album. This value is primarily for fuzzy lookups, though a user-agent may display it. xspf:track elements MAY contain exactly one. It MUST be a valid XML Schema nonNegativeInteger. -->

      <!-- The time to render a resource, in milliseconds. It MUST be a valid XML Schema nonNegativeInteger. This value is only a hint - different XSPF generators will generate slightly different values. A user-agent MUST NOT use this value to determine the rendering duration, since the data will likely be low quality. xspf:track elements MAY contain exactly one duration element. -->
